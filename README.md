## Machine Learning Model

The project includes an AI component for classifying brain tumors using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built from scratch using **PyTorch**. The model classifies MRI images of brain tumors into the following categories:
- **No Tumor**
- **Adenoma of the Pituitary Gland**
- **Meningioma**
- **Glioblastoma**

### Dataset
The dataset used includes MRI images of brain tumors labeled according to these four categories. This dataset facilitates training and evaluating the CNN model.

### Implementation

#### Model Architecture
- **CNN Architecture**: The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers to ensure effective feature extraction and accurate classification.

#### Training Process
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized and pixel values normalized to prepare the data for training.
- **Optimization**: The loss function and optimizer are defined, and the model is trained over several epochs, with validation accuracy being monitored throughout.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Model Overfitting**: Early signs of overfitting were mitigated by introducing dropout layers, improving model generalization.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting the learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs required iterative testing and careful monitoring of the loss curve.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Ensuring that images were resized and normalized correctly was key to achieving consistent model performance.
4. **Learning PyTorch**: As a beginner, implementing the CNN architecture using PyTorch posed initial challenges, but it offered valuable learning experiences.

### Future Work
- **Data Augmentation**: Experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve the modelâ€™s robustness.
- **Transfer Learning**: Explore transfer learning using pre-trained models to enhance accuracy.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Investigate ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models for improved performance.

## Databases

The system uses relational databases with primary keys for record identification and foreign keys to represent relationships between tables. Lucidchart was used to design database relationships before implementing them in **SQL Server**.

## Model Repository
